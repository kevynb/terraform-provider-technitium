  Manage DNS resource records for domains hosted on GoDaddy

# GoDaddy DNS management plugin: `godaddy-dns`

This plug-in allows for management of individual DNS resource records for domains hosted on GoDaddy servers.

It only manages DNS (no e.g. domain orders management) and deals with individual DNS records (not the whole domain), preserving existing records and tolerating external modifications.

## Configuration

Provider configuration is simple and usually empty, providing that authentication info is set in environment variables `GODADDY_API_KEY` and `GODADDY_API_SECRET` (see [GoDaddy API docs](https://developer.godaddy.com/) for instructions on how to get them). Alternatively, they can be set in `api_key` and `api_secret` parameters.

## DNS Record resource : `dns_record`

DNS entries are described as instances of `dns_records` resource.

It currently supports `A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `MX`, `NS` and `TXT` records. `SRV` are not supported; if anyone hosting AD on GoDaddy or uses SRV for VOIP or something like that, please let me know by creating an issue.

Example usage:

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

To set several records, use `for_each`:

{{ tffile "examples/several_records/main.tf" }}

See `dns_record` docs for additional examples.

## Differences vs alternative providers

Differences vs n3integration provider and its forks:
- granularity: main configuration object is record not top-level domain, no need to put the whole domain (with sub-domains) under terraform management
- so updates to one record do not result in scary plans threatening to destroy all the domain contents
- external modifications are mostly ok: update will not complain if record is already set to the desired state, delete will be happy if record is already gone
- `destroy` is fully supported and deletes only previously created records
